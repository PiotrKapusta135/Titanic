First machine learning project, education purpose only. Main goal was to score ~ 0.80 in the kaggle competition. Best score was 0.80143, so the goal has been achieved. I know there are a lot of mistakes, some thing could be done much faster and better. Overfitting is also a problem. I will try to improve the project as my knownledge increase.
